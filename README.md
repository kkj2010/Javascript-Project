# Welcome to Hibiscus flowers bloomed!
======================
Why Hibiscus flowers bloomed?
**Mugunghwa kkoci pieot seumnida** known as  __"Red Light, Green Light" game__ in Squid game from Netflix, is a game played widely in South Korea. The song of "mugunghwa kkoci pieot seumnida" plays during the game. The 'mugunghwa' (hibiscus) is the national flower of South Korea (the meaning of my name), also  “kkoci pieot seumnida” means that the flower has bloomed. 

## Background
In the original game, the it sings the song and as soon as she finishes singing, she looks back then players must not move. In this game, Korean culture and American culture were combined, the game is fun to play!

Your goal is to get player to the arrival line. The it will be on the finish line opposite the player. The player can only move when the it doesn't look back and the light is green. When the player stops moving, the music will stop. The speed at which the it looks back and the speed at which the color of light changes is not consistent, so player won't be able to predict when to move!
